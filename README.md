- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ernesto Murrugarra, AKA @murru. I have Mmore than 9 years of experience developing software. I consider myself a consultant at this point of my career thanks to all the projects and companies I've worked on and with.
I can make a software from scratch, starting with the design of database and processes up to the coding of back end and front end.
I have solid understanding in terms of software engineering and software architecture. I've been backed up about this with most of my most important clients in this list.
I can setup a cloud platform to deploy all the software products we build (as a team).
I'm in love of this industry and of my career and I enjoy a lot doing what I do.
What I love the most is what I learned from all the awesome people I've ever worked with, and I'm always excited to learn even more from all companies I still have to work with in the future.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all kind of tech projects and soon I will start learning game development <3. I'm available to be part fo a project to make passive incomes or if you just want to work with me.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Full React JS and Python.
